    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Your group is participating in a two-day hackathon where the goal is developing a light-weight data analysis tool that will be used in environmental protection using the **MOST RECENT DATA AVAILABLE**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will be using data from [Our World in Data](https://www.ourworldindata.org). The datasets can be found in:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Anual Change in forest area](https://ourworldindata.org/deforestation)\n",
    "1. [Annual deforestation](https://ourworldindata.org/deforestation)\n",
    "1. [Share of land that is protected](https://ourworldindata.org/sdgs/life-on-land)\n",
    "1. [Share of land that is degraded](https://ourworldindata.org/sdgs/life-on-land)\n",
    "1. [A fifth dataset you find relevant](https://ourworldindata.org/sdgs/life-on-land)\n",
    "1. [Map dataset: Admin 0 – Countries; Download Countries](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/)\n",
    "\n",
    "A little help for the latter file:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "import geopandas as gpd\n",
    "world = gpd.read_file(\"ne_110m_admin_0_countries.zip\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Go over the datasets with your group. Check the info on the website before you start. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-danger\">\n",
    "    <b> THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS FOR A DATA SCIENTIST ARE PATIENCE AND COMMUNICATION</b>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <b> Discuss the contents of the datasets with your colleagues. Understanding the data is a priority. </b>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Use whatever python tools you find apropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of the project\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to build a **[Streamlit app](https://streamlit.io/)** that will showcase your analysis.  \n",
    "Since you are also using geographical data, you will be using [geopandas](https://geopandas.org).\n",
    "Use a project structure like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "|__downloads/\n",
    "|__app\n",
    "|    |__your .py files here\n",
    "|__tests\n",
    "|    |__your test files here\n",
    "|__notebooks\n",
    "|    |__your notebooks here\n",
    "|__.gitignore\n",
    "|__README.md\n",
    "|__LICENSE.md\n",
    "|__main.py\n",

    "### Day 1, Phase 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of you will create a github repository (it does not matter who). __THE NAME OF THE REPOSITORY MUST BE \"Group_X\" where X is the letter of the group! Use a capital letter!__\n",
    "- Initialize the repo with a README.md file, a proper license, and a .gitignore for the programming language you will use. The README.md file __MUST__ have your emails in a way that it is possible to copy and paste it into outlook.\n",
    "- The one who created the repository will then give __Maintainer__ permissions to the rest of the group. Check under \"Project Information\" > \"Members\".\n",
    "- [ ] Every element of the group clones the repository to their own laptops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Day 1, Phase 2, the data\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Create a python function (**Function 1**, but you'll have to call it something else) that downloads all the required datasets into the `downloads` directory.\n",
    "- [ ] Create another function (**Function 2**, again, call it something PEP8 compatible) that merges the map with the datasets. Use `geopandas`. Make sure the left dataframe is the `geopandas` dataframe. See if there are changes needed in order for the merges to work.\n",
    "- [ ] You decide the create a Class to better handle the data for the project. All names you use __must be PEP8 compliant, like the entire project__.\n",
    "- [ ] Make a test for Function 1 and one for Function 2, in the appropriate place. If one runs **pytest** in the main directory of the project, all the tests must run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is time to integrate the functions in a class. The class will have several methods, which you will __not__ develop in the master branch in git.  \n",
    "Document everything!  \n",
    "Make your calls compliant with __pydantic__ and __static type checking__ when appliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Integrate Functions 1 and 2 in your class: During the _init_ method, both functions are execured.\n",
    "- [ ] The _init_ method must also read the datasets into corresponding dataframes which become attributes for your class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Day 1, Phase 3, the app itself\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ][ ][ ] Make a Streamlit App where you import your __Class__ and plot the maps. About your streamlit app...\n",
    "        * It should have a way to select which map to plot. Each map is one of the geopandas dataframes. Only one map at the time.\n",
    "        * It should plot a graph below the world map. According to each dataset you have, plot the most appropriate information you find, like an histogram of the top 5 countries and bottom 5 countries with annual changes in forest area.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you feel lost, don't hesitate to contact me.**\n",
